# Bamazon

This is a command-line based storefront application. All of the items available are stored in a Mysql database. 
Using the npm Inquirer package, users are prompted with a question asking them what they would like to buy 
from the items available in the table. All the items and their quantaties are shown. When the user "purchases" an item - 
the database is updated.
